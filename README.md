belkin_travel_strip_stand
=========================

A stand to help hold a Belkin travel adapter upright when used with a 2-prong to 3-prong adapter.

Basically A Belkin Mini Surge Protector Dual USB Charger - aka - http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Mini-Surge-Protector-Charger/dp/B0015DYMVO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1352877083&sr=8-1&keywords=belkin+travel+surge+protector

This is a fine device. However if you need to use this with a 2-prong to 3-prong adapter it becomes a bit unstable and you need a stand to hold it off from the wall or table it is plugged in to.

This simple 3d object serves that purpose.
